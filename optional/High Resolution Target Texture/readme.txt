I made an alternate target texture which is dark for better contrast against light backgrounds. However it is quite large (almost 400kb), so I only included a smaller one by default, and made the large one available here. To use the high res version, copy the target.paa in this folder into cav_ranges\data and overwrite.

Default: 256x256 - Size: 33 kb
High Resolution: 1024x1024 - Size: 392 kb
